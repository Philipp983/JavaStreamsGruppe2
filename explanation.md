# 2. Theoretical Inputs:

## Imperative Programming vs Declarative Programming

2.1.
The imperative approach defines a program as a sequence of statements that change the program‚Äôs state until it reaches the final state.

In contrast, the declarative approach expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow in terms of a sequence of statements.

Streams are part of the declarative programming, more specifically
functional programming:
Functional programming deals with certain key concepts such as pure function, immutable state, assignment-less programming etc.

2.2.
Important to know:
Functional Interfaces: 
## Have a look at IFunctionalInterface
If an Interface has only one interface, the compiler "knows" which method is
referenced - since there is only one! this enables us to only write the logic,
and we can cut down a lot of syntax

2.3.
What do we get from a functional Interface?
## Look at ImplementationOfIFunctionalInterface
Enables us to write with lambda syntax, compiler takes care of the surrounding syntax for us üßë‚Äçüè≠‚ô•Ô∏è
Advantage: code is more concise, we only have to care about the logic and can create wonderful oneliners ;)

What do we get from that?
Java actually has a lot of functional Interfaces!
Important to know in the beginning:

Consumer
Function
Predicate
Supplier

why? first have a look at StreamExample, then use the
_Consumer
_Function
_Predicate
_Supplier
as reference
